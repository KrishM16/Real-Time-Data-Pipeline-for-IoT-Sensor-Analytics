# 📡 Real-Time Data Pipeline for IoT Sensor Analytics 🚀  

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end real-time data engineering pipeline** for IoT sensor analytics. It covers **data ingestion, stream processing, ETL, storage, orchestration, and visualization**. The goal is to show how IoT data can be processed at scale to detect anomalies, monitor devices, and enable predictive maintenance.  

## 🔥 Key Features  
- Real-time **IoT data ingestion** using **Kafka** (with Python producer).  
- **Spark Structured Streaming** for scalable ETL & anomaly detection.  
- **Data Lake + Data Warehouse** architecture: Raw → Processed → Analytics.  
- **Delta Lake + PostgreSQL** for storage and querying.  
- **Apache Airflow** to orchestrate daily ETL pipelines.  
- **Power BI dashboards** for visualization & anomaly monitoring.  
- Fully **containerized setup** with **Docker Compose**.
